## Testing Your Setup

1. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test with curl:**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chat \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "What are some unique travel experiences in Japan?"}'
   ```

3. **Expected Response:**
   - If API keys work: Dynamic AI-generated response
   - If no API keys: Falls back to rule-based responses

## Example Responses

### With AI APIs:

**User**: "What are some unique travel experiences in Japan?"
**AI Response**: "Japan offers incredible unique experiences! Try staying in a traditional ryokan with hot springs, participate in a tea ceremony in Kyoto, visit the snow monkeys in Nagano, experience a robot restaurant in Tokyo, or sleep in a capsule hotel. For something truly special, consider visiting during cherry blossom season or staying at a temple for a meditation retreat. What type of experience interests you most?"

### Without AI APIs (Fallback):

**User**: "What are some unique travel experiences in Japan?"
**Fallback Response**: "I'd love to help you find the perfect destination! Tell me: What type of experience interests you? (adventure, relaxation, culture, food, nature). Also, what's your budget range and how long is your trip?"

## Benefits of AI Integration

‚úÖ **Handles Any Question**: Can respond to unexpected or complex travel queries
‚úÖ **Context Awareness**: Understands conversation flow and previous messages  
‚úÖ **Natural Responses**: More conversational and human-like interactions
‚úÖ **Multiple Fallbacks**: If one API fails, tries others automatically

## File Locations

- **Backend Route**: `backend/routes/chat.js`
- **Environment Variables**: `backend/.env`
- **Frontend Component**: `src/components/Chatbot.tsx`

## Troubleshooting

### If chatbot gives rule-based responses:

1. Check if API keys are correctly added to `.env` file
2. Restart the backend server after adding keys
3. Check backend console for error messages
4. Verify API keys are valid and have remaining quota

### If responses are slow:

1. Groq is fastest (1-2 seconds)
2. Gemini is medium speed (3-5 seconds)
3. Hugging Face can be slower (5-15 seconds)

### If you get API errors:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify API key permissions
3. Check if you've exceeded rate limits
4. Try a different API provider
